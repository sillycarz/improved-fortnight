# 1. Purpose & Problem Statement

Social platforms amplify impulsive reactions, fueling toxicity that damages community well‑being. The Reflective Pause Bot introduces a brief, psychology‑based pause—three CBT‑inspired questions—before a message is posted. This nudge helps users self‑regulate, aiming to reduce toxic incidents by at least **40 %** in pilot communities while keeping infrastructure costs near zero.
